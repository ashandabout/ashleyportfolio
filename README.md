###Submission 1: Portfolio Project

This project was to demonstrate our knowledge on creating a webpage from nothing using HTML and CSS. We used everything we learned in these past three weeks of class.

##Setup Instructions
1. Open your Terminal on your computer.
  The easiest way to do this is by clicking on the "Search" icon at the top right side and typing in "Terminal."
2. Then to see where you are in the Terminal type in "ls" this will list out all the repositories in your computer.
3. Next type in "cd Desktop" to navigate to your computer's Desktop.
  If you type in "ls" again you'll be able to see all the repositories on your Desktop.
4. Next you'll want to clone the directory onto your Desktop, keep in mind that you are now on the Desktop in your Terminal.
5. In an internet browser, like Chrome, go to Github.com
6. Once on Github.com you can search my profile in the search bar, type in "ashandabout"
7. Once in my Github navigate to the "repository" section.
8. Find my repository for this project it is "ashleyportfolio"
9. Next, copy my "ashleyportfolio" repository url link (in the Clone or download button)
10. Navigate back to you Terminal.
  You can verify you are on the Desktop directory by typing in ls.
11. Then use ```git clone``` and paste the url from the "ashleyportfolio" repository, this will then copy the directory on your computer so then you can view locally.
